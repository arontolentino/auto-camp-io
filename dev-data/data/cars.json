    "summary": "The Nissan GT-R is a high-performance sports car produced by Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan, unveiled in 2007.[2][3][4] It is the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, although no longer part of the Skyline range itself, that name now being used for Nissan's luxury-sport market.",
    "description": "The GT-R is an entirely new model, sharing little with the Skyline GT-R save its signature four round tail lights. Like some later generations of the Skyline GT-R, the GT-R has all-wheel drive with a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine. But the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new VR38DETT V6 engine. Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35,[8] or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for emissions standard), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations. The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname, Godzilla,[9] originally given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.",

    "summary": "The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and went on sale in May 2019.",
    "description": "Motor Trend had reported a possible Supra successor could be based on the FT-HS (Future Toyota-Hybrid Sport),[40] which debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show. The publication also reported that the fifth generation of the Supra could be powered by a 3.5-liter V-6 hybrid system generating over 298 kW (400 hp; 405 PS). Toyota quoted that it was not rushing for the Supra successor but instead was waiting to see how the sales and interests of the GT86/FR-S went.[",
